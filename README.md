# 221-project
By Sam Hollenbach and Carl Liu

##Description:
Our program runs our own matchmaking algorithm designed to simulate actual matchmaking systems found in online multiplayer videogames with ranked (competitive) gameplay.
##To run:
- Clone the repository
- Set values for TEAM_SIZE, MMR_MIN, MMR_MAX, and MMR_THRESHOLD in config.py
- Change the # of iterations you would like the simulation to run for in the parameter defined in the function called "simulate_matchmaking"
- Run the program through your editor or via Terminal by running "python matchmaking.py" (Of course you should have python installed first.) That's it!
